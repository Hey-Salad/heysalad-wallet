## Introduction

HeySalad®  ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how HeySalad Wallet ("the App") handles information when you use our mobile application.

**Key Point:** HeySalad Wallet is designed with privacy first. We do NOT collect, store, or share your personal data. Your wallet and transactions are completely private.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect:
- ❌ Personal information (name, email, phone number)
- ❌ Location data
- ❌ Usage analytics or tracking data
- ❌ Device identifiers for advertising
- ❌ Contact lists
- ❌ Photos or camera roll access (except for QR scanning)
- ❌ Financial information beyond what's on the public blockchain

## Information Stored Locally on Your Device

The following information is stored ONLY on your device and never transmitted to our servers:

### Wallet Data (Local Only)
- **Private Keys:** Encrypted and stored in iOS Secure Enclave/Keychain
- **Wallet Address:** Your TRON blockchain address
- **Transaction History:** Fetched from public blockchain

**Important:** We cannot access, recover, or reset your private keys. You are solely responsible for backing up your recovery phrase.

## How the App Works

- You control your private keys
- We cannot access your funds

- We cannot freeze your account
- Your crypto is yours alone

### Blockchain Interactions
When you use the App, you interact directly with the TRON blockchain:
- Transactions are broadcast to the public TRON network
- Your wallet address and transactions are publicly visible on the blockchain

We use TronGrid (trongrid.io) to:
- Fetch wallet balances
- Broadcast transactions
- Query blockchain data

TronGrid may collect:
- IP addresses
- API requests

Refer to [TronGrid's Privacy Policy](https://www.trongrid.io/) for their data practices.

## Blockchain Transparency

**Important:** Blockchain transactions are public by design.

- Your wallet address is public
- Transaction amounts are public

- Anyone can view this on blockchain explorers (e.g., tronscan.org)

This is standard for all cryptocurrency wallets. If you need privacy, consider using privacy-focused cryptocurrencies.

**For EU Users (GDPR):**
